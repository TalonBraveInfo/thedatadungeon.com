# The Data Dungeon

### What is this?

This is a public repository for [thedatadungeon.com](https://thedatadungeon.com), available for users to submit feature requests, bug reports, amendments, and more.

### How can I contribute?

For passing data to the indexer, we use our own markup format called ACM (Ape Config Markup), which you can learn about [here](https://github.com/QuartermindGames/acm).

Each collection featured on the site has its basic metadata provided by files under the [collections](collections) directory; depending on where these are sorted denotes the type of collection they fall under, which currently is just _games_ but will eventually be expanded.

Per a collection, you can then specify the name, publishers, developers, links, release status, date and more.
We'd recommend checking out the existing files for working examples.

### How can I submit my files to the site?

We don't allow direct uploads to the site for legal reasons.

We recommend uploading your content to a site such as [archive.org](https://archive.org), so we can mirror from thereâ€”or alternatively to upload it to some private provider (such as Google Drive) and then to get in touch with us.

Our recommendation is the former, as there may be a delay in getting your content onto our site otherwise.
We have a significant number of items that are still pending to be organized for upload to the site.

### How can I get in touch with you?

Feel free to get in touch on our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/MyqtYZuR6w).
